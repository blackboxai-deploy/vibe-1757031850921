# Android AI App Builder - Implementation Progress

## 📋 Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Base Structure
- [ ] Create main page layout (landing page)
- [ ] Set up app routing structure
- [ ] Create base layout components
- [ ] Configure navigation system

### Phase 2: Landing Page Development
- [ ] Hero section with feature highlights
- [ ] Feature cards and benefits section
- [ ] Demo section with placeholder content
- [ ] Call-to-action components

### Phase 3: Dashboard Implementation
- [ ] Project management interface
- [ ] Project grid with CRUD operations
- [ ] Template gallery system
- [ ] User preferences panel

### Phase 4: Visual App Builder Core
- [ ] Drag-and-drop canvas implementation
- [ ] Component library with Android elements
- [ ] Property panel for customization
- [ ] Real-time preview system
- [ ] Layer management system

### Phase 5: AI Integration & API Routes
- [ ] AI code generation API endpoint
- [ ] AI suggestion system API
- [ ] Layout optimization API
- [ ] AI assistant chat interface

### Phase 6: Export & Download System
- [ ] Android project structure generation
- [ ] Code compilation and formatting
- [ ] APK preview simulation
- [ ] Download manager implementation

### Phase 7: Testing & Optimization
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) → AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing
- [ ] API functionality validation with curl
- [ ] UI/UX testing across devices
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Error handling implementation
